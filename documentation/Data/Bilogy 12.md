I. Diversity in Living World
Diversity of living organisms.
Classification of the living organisms (five kingdom classification, major groups and principles
of classification within each kingdom).
Systematics and binomial system of nomenclature.
Salient features of animal (non chordates up to phylum level, and chordates up to class level) and
plant (major groups; Angiosperms up to subclass) classification.
Botanical gardens, herbaria, zoological parks and museums. (Periods 25)
Key points for developing subject matter
• The meaning of being ‘alive’.
• Living organisms show a very large diversity in form and structure ranging from unicellular to
very large multicellularwell-differentiated bodies.
• For ease of study, they have been organized into categories and this is called classification.
• Principally, all living organisms can be placed in one or the other of five kingdoms.
• Each kingdom is further subdivided; there are several levels of organisation, the lowest in the
hierarchy being the species.
• The Binomial system, literally ‘two names’, of classification is followed, where each organism
has a Latin generic name with a specific epithet.
• Zoological parks, Botanical gardens, Herbaria and Natural museums serve as Taxonomical aids.
Practicals:
Study the large variation of living organisms in the neighbourhood, note their behaviour,
characteristics, and categorize them into groups based on some common features. Study
preserved specimens, at least one representative of each group, to understand correlations
between the characteristics of organisms and their systematic position. Learn how to collect,
press, dry and prepare plant specimens with labels (common and weedy species) for the
herbarium/museum

II. Structural Organisation in Animals and Plants
Tissues in animals and plants.
Morphology, anatomy and functions of different parts of flowering plants: Root, stem, leaf,
inflorescence, flower, fruit and seed.
Morphology, anatomy and functions of different systems of an annelid (earthworm), an insect
(cockroach) and an amphibian (frog). (Periods 30)
Key points for developing subject matter
• Light and electron microscopes are used as tools for the study of tissues, cells and cell
organelles.
• Higher organisation of animals and plants is achieved through assembly of thousands/millions
of cells into specialised tissues that in turn form organs and organ systems.
• The organisation of the living body shows division of labour.
• Organisms show increasing complexity in structure and function as we move from the lower
to the higher levels.
• Plants and animals exhibit a wide range of organisation from a simple level to the complex.
• Floral characteristics form the basis of classification and identification of Angiosperms. This
can be illustrated through semi-technical descriptions of families using suitable examples of
wild and cultivated plants.
• The structure of the animal body shows a wide range in morphology and anatomy
Practicals:
Study different types of tissues in plants and animals (temporary preparations and permanent
slides). Prepare and study transverse section of roots and stems to identify different tissues. Study

and transport.
• Essential processes of cell division – mitosis and meiosis are similar in animals and plants.
• Living bodies contain different categories of micro and macro-molecules.
• Macromolecules are of four broad categories.
• Proteins, the major macro group besides providing structural support, mediate many
physiological functions like catalysis, defence, transport, and sensing.
• Enzymes are an important class of proteins responsible for all metabolic activities of the cell.
• Carbohydrates are major energy reserves, and also serve the function of providing structural
support to majority of living organisms.
• Lipids serve as major components of membranes, as energy reserves and some hormones.
• The DNA has a double helical structure.
• Nucleic acids are the genetic material, and are responsible for determining the protein synthesis.
Practicals:

Plants and water.
Mineral nutrition.
Respiration.
Photosynthesis.
Plant growth and development. (Periods 40)
Key points for developing subject matter
• Cell to cell movement of water, food, gas and nutrients is dependent principally on concentration
gradients and diffusion.
• Substances are moved against a concentration gradient through active transport.
• The plants lose water through their stomata.
• Transport of water over larger distances in plants depends on transpiration pull.
• Root pressure is responsible for movement of water up short distances and for guttation.
• Plants require a variety of mineral nutrients for their growth and development.
• Some plants are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen.
• Green plants use the C3 pathway to fix carbon dioxide and synthesize simple sugars in the
presence of sunlight.
• Some plants have the C4 pathway.
• Sugars are oxidised by all living organisms to release energy.
• Some organisms derive energy from food anaerobically.
• This energy is trapped as ATP and utilised for all metabolic activities.
• Growth regulators regulate growth and development in plants.
Practicals:

V. Human Physiology
Digestion and absorption.
Breathing and respiration.
Body fluids and circulation.
Excretory products and elimination.
Locomotion and movement.
Control and coordination. (Periods 45)
Key points for developing subject matter
• Food is broken down enzymatically in stages and nutrients absorbed as they pass through the
alimentary canal.
• The process of exchange of gases takes place at organ, tissue, cell and organelle levels leading
to oxidation of sugars in the cells.
• Gases, nutrients as well as waste products are transported in the body through the vascular system.
• The various components of the blood are involved in diverse functions.
• Metabolic wastes produced in the body are eliminated by excretory system.
• The kidneys play an important role in osmoregulation.
• Movement and locomotion involves interaction of the skeletal and muscular system; the skeleton
also protects many parts of the body.
• Control and coordination require functional integration of neural and endocrine systems in
the body.
• Sense organs are specialised to receive different stimuli and transmit them to the brain.
Practicals:

VI. Sexual Reproduction
Pollination and fertilisation in flowering plants.
Development of seeds and fruits.
Human reproduction: Reproductive system in male and female, menstrual cycle.
Production of gametes, fertilisation, implantation, embryo development, pregnancy and parturation.
Reproductive health – birth control, contraception and sexually transmitted diseases.
(Periods 35)
Key points for developing subject matter
• Plants show vegetative, asexual and sexual reproduction.
• In Angiosperms, the flowers contain the reproductive organs. They may be unisexual or bisexual.
• There are multitudes of ways of bringing together pollen and the carpel (pollination).
• In nature, pollination is subject to many uncertainties; often barriers to pollination and
incompatibility have to be overcome for successful pollination and fertilisation.
• The male gametes are produced in the pollen tube, while the female gamete is produced in the
embryo sac.
• Double fertilisation leads to the formation of embryo and the endosperm.
• The ovules in the ovary turn into seed after fertilisation. The ovary turns into a fruit.
• In animals, testes produce sperms and ovaries produce ova.
• Both male and female gametes production is under hormonal regulation; production of ova
is a cyclic process.
• During fertilization, sperms migrate through the genital tract to fuse with the ova.
• The genetic makeup of the sperm determines the sex of the unborn child.
• The fertilised egg implants in the uterine wall where it remains connected with the mother
till birth.
• The zygote undergoes cleavage, and then passes through different stages of development
leading to the formation of three germinal layers.
• After completion of the gestation period, a fully developed baby is delivered.
• Contraceptive methods interfere with one or more of the following: gamete production,
ovulation, sperm delivery, fusion of gametes and implantation. These methods of birth control
thus help in family planning.
• In IVF the ova is fertilised using a donor sperm outside the body and the
fertilised ova is implanted in the female body for further development.
• Abortion is legal, but not recommended for birth control;
prenatal sex determination (usually associated with
selective female foeticide) is illegal.
• Safe sex can help to prevent sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS

Practicals:
Study of flowers adapted to pollination by different agencies (wind, insects). Study of the
reproductive parts of unisexual and bisexual flowers. Study of pollen germination on a slide and
pollen tube growth on the stigma. Study of tissue sections of mammalian testis and ovary to
identify stages of gamete development. Study fruits and seeds of any common fruit (e.g. legume)
at different stages of development.


VII. Genetics and Evolution

DNA fingerprinting.
Evolution: Theories and evidences. (Periods 45)
Key points for developing subject matter
• Plants and animals show Mendelian inheritance.
• Organisms may also show cytoplasmic inheritance.
• DNA carries information from one generation to the next.
• Human inheritance pattern can be exemplified by pattern of inheritance of blood groups and
haemophilia.
• Genes on the same chromosomes show linkage and are inherited together unless crossing
over occurs.
• The Lac operon exemplifies a typical model of gene regulation.
• Sequencing of Human DNA under the Human Genome Project aims at finding solutions for
genetic disorders and several health problems.
• DNA fingerprinting is also used for identification and crime detection.
• Diversity in animals and plants arises out of variations in the genetic material.
• Mutation is an important source of variation.
• Further, variations in genetic material would affect the entire population over generations to
give rise to new species and, therefore, lead to evolution.
• The process of evolution is explained by various theories (Lamarckism, Darwinism and NeoDarwinism). Different types of evidences support the theories.
Practicals:
Study mitosis in onion root tips and animal cells (grasshopper) and meiosis in onion buds and
grasshopper testis (permanent slides). Stain tissue section for nucleic acids (aceto carmine stain).

Cancer and AIDS.
Adolescence and drug/alcohol abuse. (Periods 35)
Key points for developing subject matter
• Traditionally farm animals have been bred for increased productivity, disease and pest resistance.
• The human body has its own defence mechanism.
• The defence system is constantly under attack from diverse sources – pollutants, chemicals and
infectious organisms.
• Our body is capable of producing millions of types of antibodies to trap/remove and
overcome the adverse effects of these foreign bodies/chemicals.
• However, against some infectious organisms we need to develop antibodies in advance, i.e.
acquired immunity.
• Vaccination can help in developing immunity to specific diseases.
• Genetically engineered micro organisms are serving as bioreactors for production of vaccines
and drugs.
• Infectious organisms like helminths (Ascariasis, Filaria), protozoa (Amoebiasis, Malaria), bacteria
(Typhoid, Pneumonia), viruses (common cold, AIDS) and fungi (Ring worm) attacks specific
systems of our body and produce characteristic symptoms.
• Each infectious organism, therefore, requires individual preventive measures.
• Some of these preventive measures demand improved personal hygiene and living conditions.
• Traditional plant breeding has been the method of creating varieties that are high on yield,
resistance to pests and diseases and adapted to a given climatic condition. This has been the
source of green revolution in India.
• New methods of propagation using tissue culture and genetic alteration using rDNA technology
provide novel methods of crop improvement, horticulture, pest resistance.
• Microbes thrive by degradation/conversion of organic and inorganic compounds
• These characteristics of microbes can be exploited to produce household products (yoghurt/
vinegar), for industrial production, treatment of sewage and energy generation.
• Diseases like cancer and AIDS – the major cause of death in the modern world – need
adequate preventive/control measures.
• Some people who are unable to handle the emotional stress and strain of growing up find
apparent relief in actions like drug and alcohol consumption; in reality a non-solution since it
leads to severe repercussions like physiological and emotional disorders.
Practicals:
Exercise on controlled pollination – emasculation, tagging and bagging. Identify common disease
causing organisms such as Ascaris, Entamoeba, Plasmodium, ring worm. Comment on the symptoms
of the diseases that they cause



IX. Biotechnology and its Applications
Recombinant DNA technology.
Applications in Health, Agriculture and Industry.
Genetically modified (GM) organisms; biosafety issues.
Insulin and Bt cotton. (Periods 30)
Key points for developing subject matter
• DNA is a long polymer that can be edited by cutting and joining in any desired way. The
edited DNA molecule (recombinant DNA) can be reintroduced into microbes, animals or
plants to create genetically modified (GM) organisms or transgenics.
• rDNA technology is the very basis of many applications in biotechnology – for example to
produce desired drugs and for gene therapy.
• rDNA technology has also played a major role in production of GM foods which have the
advantage of high yields, pest and disease resistance.
• Use of GM food and crops has raised several questions regarding its bio-safety from the
point of human consumption, environment and other social issues.
• A combination of classical breeding with rDNA technology and genetic modification has
great potential for animal breeding.
• While cloning has been in use for plants since several decades, use of the technique in animals,
particularly human cloning, raises several ethical and other issues.
• rDNA technology (gene therapy) can provide effective remedies for several genetic disorders.
• Bioreactors have been developed for production of vaccines and drugs.

Key points for developing subject matter
• The living organisms in their environment form a structural and functional unit in terms of
energy flow (ecological pyramids).
• The biotic and abiotic components within an ecosystem interact with each other.
• Several types of ecosystems can be classified and identified in nature depending on the climate,
habitat, energy flow pattern and the physiognomy.
• In nature, organisms do not occur singly but exist as populations and communities.
• Plants and animals are adapted to their habitats such as in deserts and in water.
• Several factors affect biodiversity including natural and anthropogenic activities.
• In India, women have played a major role in conservation of plants, animals and natural resources.
• The need of the present day is to conserve biodiversity for a sustainable living; several
conservation methods have been adopted.
• Conservation of biodiversity may be in situ or ex situ.
• The ‘Silent Valley’ as a case study, to understand the value of environmental impact assessment
and the role of peoples’ participation.
• Introduction to the idea that new products, processes and ideas related to biodiversity can be
patented (Intellectual Property Rights, IPR).
• Pollution, deforestation, global warming, ozone layer depletion, underground water level and threat
to biodiversity (with special reference to wild life) are some among many environmental concerns.
